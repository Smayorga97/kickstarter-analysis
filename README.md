# Kickstarting-Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Background
Louise is an up and coming playwright wants to start a Kickstarting campaing so she it helps her to fund her play "Fever", she is expecting a budget of over $10,000 dollars so she is turning to us, Excels power users,
to help and set her up for success. 

### Purpose 
The purpose of this challenge is to use Excel to Organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine wheter there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. Analyzing current side data, We will
help her to gain a greater understanding on how her campaing can be succesful. There are 2 Analyses that are required to help her:
	
	-Theather outcomes based on launch date
	-Ooutcomes Based on Goals   

## Analysis and Challenges:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The purpose of this analaysis is to see if seasonality affects the outcome of a campaing. We created a new Column called "year" in ([Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) so we could Analyse if the Launch date had any affect on the outcome, then we moved on to filter the data in such a way the outcome results showed beside every month. If we Analayze the data we could get a success rate by dividing the succesful outcomes by the total outcomes for every month, when doing this we can see that May has the highest rate. However, why create more equations when we can analyze the graph below, we could see that there is a spike in May for campaings to succeed, therefore May is the best month to start a campaing.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The main point from this analysis was to obtain visualization on the outcome percentage based on the funding goals for each campaing. To get a result we had to collect data create ranges of goal amounts and then see the number of outcomes according to each range. We were required to use CountIfs and being able to allocate the right data to the right equations. We creted a line graph that showed the ranges and their outcome percentages in order to have better visualization.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Skill wise, it was difficult for me to use the CountIfs equation to analyze the outcomes based on goals, it was the first time I ever used it in an assigment/work. However, it was was not that complicated after it is practiced a couple times. Github is a new platform for me and it has been difficult to navigate it, wish there was a more simple platform where we could manage our portafolio.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 If we Analayze the data we could get a success rate by dividing the succesful outcomes by the total outcomes for every month, when doing this we can see that May has the highest rate. However, why create more equations when we can analyze the graph below, we could see that there is a spike in May for campaings to succeed, therefore May is the best month to start a campaing. and the worst time to starts a campaing would be December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
from analyzing the data it can be concluded that kickstarting programs are most likely to be successful when the goals are set low, considering that Louise has a budget of $1000, she should keep it below that not go past that. The ideal range would be 5000 to 9999

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- I think it would be Ideal to add genders to this Data set, considering that the genders are really biased when it comes to theatre and play. there is data that I do know find Ideal for the type of Analisys that we were making and tend to provent the analyst to have less vison of the actual data needed and therefore not time efficient for the Analisys.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- I think a better Analysis could be done by filtering countries and making them aplicable to the case, in this case it would be ideal to know where Louise is from and clreate double Bar graphs that show sucessful vs failed.
